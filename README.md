# Operating-Platforms

1. The client, the Gaming Room, is a game development team who wanted to comission software to support their latest project called "Draw it or Lose it", similar to the classic "Win, Lose, or Draw" title. It is a web-based title that'd support multiple teams of players competing with each other to successfully guess a rendered image from the system's vast library.

2. I think I did fairly well iterating the document overall, but where I believe I performed best was in the Executive Summary and Requirements sections, where I believed I covered all major aspects and details of the system and stated them in a brief but concise manner.

3. I found utilizing and breaking down the UML diagram helped the most when writing the actual code. I looked at the diagram as a sort-of pesudocode which did wonders for keeping my actual coding process focused and the code itself lightweight.

4. I would've liked to revise my evaluation of different OS's. While I made good points, I think I could've done more research on server prices and development tools for a more accurate evaluation.

5. The user's needs are of the maximum upmost simply because they are who will actually be utilizing the system on the regular. Thus, I tailored my designs to not only satisfy the client's considerations, but also factor the user's ease of use, experience, and efficiency.

6. I utilized what I've learned from the Agile method and Scrum tactics from earlier courework to help with outlining my developmental process for this project, only tailoring it on the scale of myself being the sole worker. I broke up each party of developmental into smaller sections with set times to complete certain amounts of work and reach certain milestones. This allowed me to always stay on schedule, always made sure work was completed, and never fall behind. I'd love to utilize these tactics in an actual team in the future.
